# Snake

This is the code I came up with following the guide: [Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners #5][link].

It is a simple snake game. The game is run inside the terminal. Everytime you want to make a move, you must hit the enter key. To change directions,
press the following keys before hitting Enter:

W for going up
S for going down
A for going left
D for going right.

The walls are go-through - you will end up on the other side if you go through the wall.

It has no dependencies - just run `python main.py` and enjoy.
